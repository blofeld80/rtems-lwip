Overview
--------

The rtems-lwip repository serves as a central location to manage integration of
lwIP with RTEMS in a more user-accessible manner and to provide a repository of
network drivers for RTEMS BSPs.

File Origins
------------

The sources presented here originate in one of several locations described by
the ORIGIN.* files and whose license is described by the COPYING.* files.
Commits adding such files should include the hash of the target repository if
applicable.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. Populate the git submodules:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
2. Configure and build
```
./waf configure --prefix=INSTALL_PREFIX
./waf
./waf install
```

More `waf` arguments can be found by using:
`./waf --help`

Further Build Information
-------------------------

The BSPs configured to build may be specified on the waf configure command line
with --rtems-bsps or they may be configured in config.ini as in RTEMS. The
command line option will override the BSPs configured in config.ini, but options
in config.ini will still be applied for enabled BSPs. Any additional
configuration options desired in lwipopts.h may be specified in config.ini under
the appropriate section as key/value pairs like so:

[aarch64/xilinx_zynqmp_lp64_zu3eg]
LWIP_IGMP=1
ZYNQMP_USE_SGMII=1
